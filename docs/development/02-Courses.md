# Courses
The content of SALP is provided through courses. Course can be written by other developers or just course authors.

A course ships:
* Tutorials/Guides/Examples containing *texts*, *images*, *code*, etc.
* Assignments
* Docker images (configuration) for a practical example

## Package
A course is a [npm package](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-packages-and-modules) like the other packages, too. An example can be found at `packages/salp-course-example`.

Every course must follow the naming convention "`salp-course-<course-name>`".
